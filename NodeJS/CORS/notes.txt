CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in web browsers that allows servers to specify which domains are permitted to access their resources. It works by adding specific headers to responses, enabling controlled access to resources from different origins. This mechanism ensures that only trusted websites can interact with your server while maintaining the flexibility needed for modern web applications. By managing CORS settings, developers can securely handle cross-origin requests, ensuring data protection and compliance with security policies.
