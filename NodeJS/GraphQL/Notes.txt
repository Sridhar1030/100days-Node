GraphQL is a query language
Alternative to using a REST API

Eg rest api endpoints
pokemonsite.com/api/pokemon
pokemonsite.com/api/pokemon/123

Drawbacks
1. Overfetching
2. Underfetching

Like postman is used to test REST API 
Apollo is used to test GraphQL APIS
GraphQL make a Graph the query allows us to traverse the graph
